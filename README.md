# whatprovides

whatprovides is a tool to find what package and bundle provide a binary in Clear Linux OS

## Getting Started

Usually, as Clear Linux user is handy to have a tool that tells us what package (rpm) provides a binary or a library that we are using. With whatprovides, this is possible with one single command line. Download the latest release uncompress and with Autotools you can easily build the project

### Prerequisites

Autotools and GCC

```
autoreconf -i
make
```

### Installing

whatprovides uses the basic Autotools system

```
cd whatprovides
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
```

Then put your dnf.conf in /etc

The dnf.conf from Clear Linux can be downloaded from:
